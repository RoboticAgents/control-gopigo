# Progress Report by Gary, Makell

Shield bot, GoPiGo robot

## Completed Prototype

As of recording, most of the implementation regarding commands such as `w,a,s,d, and f` are complete. As demostrated during the lab session, the `w` command allows the our robot to go foward. The `a` command is for left turns, `d` command is for right turns, `s` command for going backward, and finally the `f` command is for stopping the robot itself.


## Remaining Work

For next week, we will be implementing a GUI for the user. The of the GUI is to increase usability and reliability of the program itself. The second thing we will do is regarding the music playing feature of our project. By the end of next Wednesday, we will will have three additional commands corresponding with three different music files.
