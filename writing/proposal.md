# Project Proposal by Gary, Makell

## Proposed Project Idea

Clearly describe your idea for a final project, including what robot you plan to use, what application you focusing on and why, and include any background references you used to develop the idea for your project (links are okay).

Thanks to a certain up and coming holiday, we came up with a idea for our evo arm to draw a christmas tree. In more detail, sense the evoarm is able to grab and grib bricks, we can use the logic to grib a marker and draw a simple picture.


## Acceptance Criteria

In a bulleted list, include predefined requirements that must be met for your project to be considered complete. You must identify at least five requirements for your robotic system to satisfy the goals of the project you are setting. These requirements must be specific, easily verifiable, and be an important part of the project's success. For example, for a robot delivery system, some of the requirements might include building correct map of a specific environment, correctly delivering items to the location, and correctly returning to its base location.

- Evo Arm, has to be able to pick up items. 
- Evo Arm has to hold the marker at a certain angle.
- marker has to touch the white board
- Evo Arm drawing certain shapes to make a picture.
- Image of a tree must be created
- Optional, camera work. 

## Feasibility

Explain why is your proposed idea feasible. For example, are you extending a previous project or have a sample code from someone else's project to start with?

Our project is like a continuation of our previous projects. We got our evo arm to move and pick up certain items. Our next step is to create a 3d printed box that is able to hold on to the marker. The next thing we have to do is make the drawing motion more precise and efficient. 


## Additional Hardware

If your project requires additional hardware, please list it below and include a link to a website where it can be purchased. If you need resources other than hardware, please list them as well. If you do not require any additional resources, just state that fact.

Currently we don't really need any additional hardware. 

- draw erase board
- draw erase marker
- 3d printed grib
